Coding Challenge #8 | JavaScript ðŸ”¥ | Lecture 047
Let's improve Steven's tip calculator even more, this time using loops!

Your tasks:
1. Create an array 'bills' containing all 10 test bill values
2. Create empty arrays for the tips and the totals ('tips' and 'totals')
3. Use the 'calcTip' function we wrote before (no need to repeat) to calculate tips
and total values (bill + tip) for every bill value in the bills array. Use a for loop to perform the 10 calculations!

Test data: 22, 295, 176, 440, 37, 105, 10, 1100, 86 and 52
Hints: Call â€˜calcTip â€˜in the loop and use the push method to add values to the tips and totals arrays ðŸ˜‰

Bonus:
4. Bonus: Write a function 'calcAverage' which takes an array called 'arr' as an argument.
This function calculates the average of all numbers in the given array.
This is a difficult challenge (we haven't done this before)! Here is how to solve it:
4.1. First, you will need to add up all values in the array. To do the addition,
start by creating a variable 'sum' that starts at 0.
Then loop over the array using a for loop. In each iteration,
add the current value to the 'sum' variable. This way, by the end of the loop,
you have all values added together.
4.2. To calculate the average, divide the sum you calculated before by the length of the array (because that's the number of elements).
4.3. Call the function with the 'totals' array.

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

//solution
let billsArray = [22, 295, 176, 440, 37, 105, 10, 1100, 86, 52];
let tips = [];
let total = [];

const calcTip = (billVal) => {
    let tipCalc = ((billVal >= 50) && (billVal <= 300)) ? billVal * 0.15 : billVal * 0.2
    return tipCalc;
}

for (let i = 0; i < billsArray.length; i++) {

    tips.push(calcTip(billsArray[i]));
    total.push(billsArray[i] + tips[i]);
}

console.log(billsArray, tips, total);


//Bonus:
function calcAverage(arr) {
    let sum = 0; // Step 4.1: Initialize sum variable

    // Step 4.1: Loop over the array and add each element to sum
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        sum += arr[i];
    }

    // Step 4.2: Calculate the average by dividing sum by the length of the array
    let average = sum / arr.length;

    return average;
}

// Example usage:
//let totals = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
let totals = [22, 295, 176, 440, 37, 105, 10, 1100, 86, 52];
let average = calcAverage(totals);
console.log("Average:", average); // Output the calculated average
console.log(calcAverage(tips), calcAverage(total));
